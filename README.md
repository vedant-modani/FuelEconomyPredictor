### Fuel Economy Predictor

This Linear Regression project aims to predict the fuel economy in Miles per Gallon (MPG) for a dataset of cars. 
The project also explores using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and whether they are suitable for a fairly simple dataset.

I would like to acknowledge Maven Analytics for providing the data and isnpiring the project.
